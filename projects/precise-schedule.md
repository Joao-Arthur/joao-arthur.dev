# Precise Schedule

## The original project

In 2018, I developed a Java schedule application named PreciseSchedule. Back then, I lacked knowledge about clean code, clean architecture, data structures, and testing.
Shortly after completing the application, I had the urge to rewrite it, applying the knowledge gained.

## The rewriting

I dedicated myself to rewrite the application from time to time. In 2021, I developed most of the frontend, but I was not satisfied using a framework on the backend, even though I didn't had the knowledge to develop the project without one.
Finally, in the middle of 2023, after learning DDD, I wrote a new backend, and then focused on finishing the frontend.

## The realization

Writing code in itself is much enjoyable. But, investing time in a project without users is meaningless. Because of that I've currently put this project on hold, without plans for further development.
It took me 5 years to rewrite this project, but it was worthwhile.

## The lessons

Through the process, I learned:
 - How much time I take to implement a feature
 - To focus on one task at a time
 - To shrink the features to their essentials
 - To start development by core functionality
 - That the architecture is more important than the code
 - That my life cannot be only programming

## Final application
