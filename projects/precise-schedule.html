<h2>The original project</h2>
<p>In 2018, I developed a Java schedule application named PreciseSchedule. Back then, I lacked knowledge about clean code, clean architecture, data structures, and testing.
Shortly after completing the application, I had the urge to rewrite it, applying the knowledge gained.</p>
<h2>The rewriting</h2>
<p>Since the completion of the original project in 2018, I dedicated time to write the application from time to time. In 2021, I developed most of the frontend, but I was not satisfied by using a framework on the backend. And I didn&#x27;t had the knowledge to develop the project without one.
Finally, in the middle of 2023, after learning DDD, I wrote a new backend, and then focused on finishing the frontend.</p>
<h2>The realization</h2>
<p>Writing code in itself is much enjoyable. However, the purpose of software is to serve people. Thus, investing time in a project without users is meaning unless it&#x27;s for learning. Not only that, my original objective was to create a fully functional system that would have taken months to develop, only to stay on my portfolio.</p>
<p>As a result, after three months, my motivation waned. I resolved to condense the scope of the project to a minimum and then implemented those features. Having finished this, I&#x27;ve currently put this project on hold, without plans for further development.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It took me 5 years to rewrite this project, but it was worthwhile</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The lessons</h2>
<p>Through the process, I learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much time I take to implement a feature</li>
<li>To focus on one task at a time</li>
<li>To shrink the features to their essentials</li>
<li>To start development by core functionality</li>
<li>That the architecture is more important than the code</li>
<li>That my life cannot be only programming</li>
</ul>
