{"pageProps":{"md":"# Precise Schedule\n\n## The original project\n\nIn 2018, I developed a Java schedule application named PreciseSchedule. Back then, I lacked knowledge about clean code, clean architecture, data structures, and testing.\nShortly after completing the application, I had the urge to rewrite it, applying the knowledge gained.\n\n## The rewriting\n\nI dedicated myself to rewrite the application from time to time. In 2021, I developed most of the frontend, but I was not satisfied using a framework on the backend, even though I didn't had the knowledge to develop the project without one.\nFinally, in the middle of 2023, after learning DDD, I wrote a new backend, and then focused on finishing the frontend.\n\n## The realization\n\nWriting code in itself is much enjoyable. But, investing time in a project without users is meaningless. Because of that I've currently put this project on hold, without plans for further development.\nIt took me 5 years to rewrite this project, but it was worthwhile.\n\n## The lessons\n\nThrough the process, I learned:\n - How much time I take to implement a feature\n - To focus on one task at a time\n - To shrink the features to their essentials\n - To start development by core functionality\n - That the architecture is more important than the code\n - That my life cannot be only programming\n\n## Final application\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
