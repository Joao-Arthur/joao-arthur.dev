{"pageProps":{"md":"# Precise Schedule\n\n## The original project\n\nIn 2018, I developed a Java schedule application named PreciseSchedule. Back then, I lacked knowledge about clean code, clean architecture, data structures, and testing.\nShortly after completing the application, I had the urge to rewrite it, applying the knowledge gained.\n\n## The rewriting\n\nSince the completion of the original project in 2018, I dedicated time to write the application from time to time. In 2021, I developed most of the frontend, but I was not satisfied by using a framework on the backend. And I didn't had the knowledge to develop the project without one.\nFinally, in the middle of 2023, after learning DDD, I wrote a new backend, and then focused on finishing the frontend.\n\n## The realization\n\nWriting code in itself is much enjoyable. However, the purpose of software is to serve people. Thus, investing time in a project without users is meaning unless it's for learning. Not only that, my original objective was to create a fully functional system that would have taken months to develop, only to stay on my portfolio.\n\nAs a result, after three months, my motivation waned. I resolved to condense the scope of the project to a minimum and then implemented those features. Having finished this, I've currently put this project on hold, without plans for further development.\n> It took me 5 years to rewrite this project, but it was worthwhile\n\n## The lessons\n\nThrough the process, I learned:\n - How much time I take to implement a feature\n - To focus on one task at a time\n - To shrink the features to their essentials\n - To start development by core functionality\n - That the architecture is more important than the code\n - That my life cannot be only programming\n\n## Final application\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
